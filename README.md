# 3D-Dice

This is a simple 3d dice that rotates. It is very simple but I wanted to explore and learn bore about 3d with in CSS. 

When I comes to tektology that was used in the task, I chose to use Scss and basic html. Just to learn from the bottom and understand how each element works, later on I will maybe implement this in a bigger project but for now it will just be a rotating Dice on a white web page. 

I you want to use this in your project you are free to use it, just go for it 


 I will also add a link where you can find it
